## About Me
  I've played soccer my whole life have a family of four me my sister my dad and my mom my  dad is actually a programmer. I aspire to be like him to my mom's a nurse and my sister is also attending Mizzou hoping to become a programer. I've lived here in Columbia my whole life as well.I used to live in Jefferson City I moved  to Columbia when I was in second grade we came here because both my parents found better job opportunities. 
  I'm very glad with this decision because  is a lot more to do here in Columbia then there is to do in Jeff City. the only time I be going down there  is for soccer practice that's the one thing Jeff City has on Columbia the soccer teams there are pretty good. do Columbia does have a lot of good talented players,  even more than Jeff City the teams here are ran by pretty bad coaches. My favorite soccer team is Arsenal, clear my favorite because when I was a kid I saw the soccer commercial  which animated all the Premier League teams logos and I saw Arsenal's Cannon and thought it was the coolest thing ever. 
## Other Intrests
  I also enjoy watching other sports like basketball and football. My favorite basketball team is the LA Lakers but that's really only because LeBrons on there she's my favorite player so I'll just follow him end my favorite football team are the Green Bay Packers because green is my favorite color.
