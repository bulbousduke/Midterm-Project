## About Me
  I've played soccer my whole life have a family of four me my sister my dad and my mom my  dad is actually a programmer. I aspire to be like him to my mom's a nurse and my sister is also attending Mizzou hoping to become a programer. I've lived here in Columbia my whole life as well.I used to live in Jefferson City I moved  to Columbia when I was in second grade we came here because both my parents found better job opportunities.
  
  I'm very glad with this decision because  is a lot more to do here in Columbia then there is to do in Jeff City. the only time I be going down there  is for soccer practice that's the one thing Jeff City has on Columbia the soccer teams there are pretty good. do Columbia does have a lot of good talented players,  even more than Jeff City the teams here are ran by pretty bad coaches. My favorite soccer team is [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/), clear my favorite because when I was a kid I saw the soccer commercial  which animated all the Premier League teams logos and I saw Arsenal's Cannon and thought it was the coolest thing ever. 
  
## Other Intrests
  I also enjoy watching other sports like basketball and football. My favorite basketball team is the [LA Lakers]() but that's really only because [LeBron](https://www.google.com/search?q=lebron+james&sxsrf=ALiCzsZfG6rYy5HzhL3vT2Skn38refbJfg%3A1666300500318&ei=VLpRY6b1EoOxqtsPyIe9-As&gs_ssp=eJzj4tTP1TcwzKoySzFg9OLJSU0qys9TyErMTS0GAF9OB_c&oq=lebr&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQARgAMgoILhCxAxCDARBDMgUIABCRAjIKCAAQsQMQgwEQQzIECAAQQzIFCAAQgAQyBAgAEEMyCggAELEDEIMBEEMyBAgAEEMyCAgAELEDEIMBMgsILhCABBCxAxCDAToHCCMQ6gIQJzoHCC4Q6gIQJzoECCMQJzoICC4QsQMQgwFKBAhNGAFKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQrQhY2RBg9h1oAXABeACAAY0CiAHiBZIBBTAuMy4xmAEAoAEBsAEKwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) is on there she's my favorite player so I'll just follow him and my favorite football team are the [Green Bay Packers](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tDP1TcwTjLOMmD0EkwvSk3NU0hKrFQoSEzOTi0qBgB9HwlC&q=green+bay+packers&oq=green&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j46i67i131i433j46i67j46i67i433j0i67j46i67i199i465j46i175i199i512j46i67i433j46i67j0i67.2744j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) because green is my favorite color.
