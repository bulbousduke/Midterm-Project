## About Me
  I've played soccer my whole life have a family of four me my sister my dad and my mom my  dad is actually a programmer. I aspire to be like him to my mom's a nurse and my sister is also attending Mizzou hoping to become a programer. I've lived here in Columbia my whole life as well.I used to live in Jefferson City I moved  to Columbia when I was in second grade we came here because both my parents found better job opportunities.

  I'm very glad with this decision because  is a lot more to do here in Columbia then there is to do in Jeff City. the only time I be going down there  is for soccer practice that's the one thing Jeff City has on Columbia the soccer teams there are pretty good. do Columbia does have a lot of good talented players,  even more than Jeff City the teams here are ran by pretty bad coaches. My favorite soccer team is [Arsenal](https://www.arsenal.com/), clear my favorite because when I was a kid I saw the soccer commercial  which animated all the Premier League teams logos and I saw Arsenal's Cannon and thought it was the coolest thing ever.

## Job Life
Right now I work at the Jamaican Jerk Hut my dad's authentic Jamaican food restaurant. I've been working there for about 2 years now my one and only job it's pretty good. overall it's just super chill And fun to a certain extent when a bunch of people walk in at once it can be a bit overwhelming. As long as you got an all the tasks done for the day and Saturday ra customer up front you can just relax.
